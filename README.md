## Banking domain 

This repository contains my project on Supervised Learning. 
These are practice projects which I wrote while learning and understanding the topic.

Objective: The classification goal is to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans.

Data Description: 
The file Bank.xls contains data on 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan). Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign.
Domain: Banking

Context:
This case is about a bank whose management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with minimal budget.
Learning Outcomes: 
•	Exploratory Data Analysis
•	Preparing the data to train a model
•	Training and making predictions using a classification model
•	Model evaluation
•	Split the data into training and test set in the ratio of 70:30 respectively 5.Use different classification models (Logistic, K-NN and Naïve Bayes) to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans 6.Print the confusion matrix for all the above models 7.
